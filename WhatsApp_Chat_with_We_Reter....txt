05/05/21, 11:39 - Vamc Aarya: Depends on type of client
05/05/21, 11:39 - Naveen Kumar: Theek hai
05/05/21, 11:39 - Naveen Kumar: Since we are beginners kada
05/05/21, 11:43 - Naveen Kumar: Webinar sign up
05/05/21, 12:14 - Vamc Aarya: Took a break. Sleep time
05/05/21, 12:14 - Naveen Kumar: Theek hai
05/05/21, 5:29 - Vamc Aarya: Woke up
05/05/21, 5:29 - Vamc Aarya: And started
05/05/21, 5:37 - Naveen Kumar: Aakasham taakela vadagaalai eenelq andinche aahwanam ad antey
05/05/21, 7:33 - Naveen Kumar: There are two types of psychological methods that advertisement people use:
1.Mere exposure(by constantly exposing ads to users they will get the attention of users and usually people have the stereotype that if a line at the bank is longer either the bank should be credible or good and the same goes with medicines also(for example if we take the two kinds of medicine with same composition and among them one is a brand people don't buy the other even if we say that it's of the same composition) and even in a survey which has been conducted among the patients by giving them two types of doses(both are same composition but one is of high brand(atleast the patients were told so) the patients who took the high brand dose recovered 28% faster) but both took the same composition the moral of the survey is that expectations bring the results
05/05/21, 7:37 - Naveen Kumar: 2. Classical conditioning (people will be conditioned gradually with the ads(for example: cars, they will show a luxurious man with a tie driving it and when it comes to SUVs the same rich man is going on an adventurous journey with the SUV) here the people will buy the lifestyle by buying that car) when a person becomes rich they subconsciously relate the image with that and buy it to lead that kind of lifestyle) they merely talk about the product but moreover they will create an image in them subconsciously)
05/05/21, 7:41 - Naveen Kumar: So here the thing is when we choose fields like hotels(food), medicines, cars(anything that has to do with health and lifestyle) we can go for high prices because of the quality ads(Ads should be of high quality) because people feel that higher the cost higher the quality and higher the performance
05/05/21, 7:46 - Naveen Kumar: Moreover when it comes to hotels we should definitely include an image in which person enjoying the food completely and this is applicable to all the health and lifestyle related ads
05/05/21, 7:49 - Naveen Kumar: Applicable to Jyms, food, fashion(clothes and gadgets), medicines, cricket equipment, cosmetics
05/05/21, 7:49 - Naveen Kumar: Along with this the necessity and how this particular place or product resolves that necessity....
05/05/21, 8:30 - Naveen Kumar: There's a difference between bribe(if you give something because you have bought something) and offer(a discount on what you buy) mathematically they may be equal sometimes but perceptionally they are different and as  marketers we should develop perspective (how can we improve the user's experience psychologically rather than logically)
05/05/21, 8:34 - Naveen Kumar: Some stereotypes which work better for advertisers:
1. Medicines work well if they are costly
2. Car works better after you clean it
3. Chocolate looks sweeter if the blocks around it are round rather than square
05/05/21, 8:34 - Naveen Kumar: What we see overrides what we hear..
05/05/21, 8:40 - Vamc Aarya: üî•
05/05/21, 8:42 - Vamc Aarya: Brand image antav aithe
05/05/21, 8:45 - Vamc Aarya: 3rd true ?
05/05/21, 8:45 - Vamc Aarya: Okay repu call chesthaa ippudu nak pani undi avvadhu
05/05/21, 9:09 - Naveen Kumar: Yup
05/05/21, 9:42 - Naveen Kumar: Sense of urgency always works in advertisement....
05/05/21, 10:36 - Naveen Kumar: People look for cheaper flights/trains but not for cheaper hotels....
05/05/21, 10:36 - Naveen Kumar: I mean food hotels..
05/05/21, 10:41 - Naveen Kumar: 1 person buying 7 products and 7 people buying 1 product is objectively (mathematically) same but subjectively not...always look on subjective evaluation...
05/05/21, 10:44 - Naveen Kumar: Subjective evaluation works....If lift/elevator is somehow slow, the logical answer to that is to increase it's speed by repairing it...but if you attach a full size mirror inside it people don't complain about slow speed...And another example is that if you want to build a high speed railway track between two cities that runs at a particular point of time, don't do that rather allow people to enter the train that's available even if they haven't booked a ticket in that train(create an app that can do) which ultimately saves the time of passenger which the super fast train does
05/05/21, 10:45 - Naveen Kumar: Cost conscious and subjective solutions
05/05/21, 10:46 - Naveen Kumar: Medicines taste not good just to make people believe it's a medicine(sometimes if a tonic is good manufacturers add something that makes it taste not good just to make people believe it's a medicine)
05/05/21, 10:47 - Naveen Kumar: Same thing goes for diet coke, diet coke should not taste sweet like a normal coke otherwise people don't feel it as a diet coke..
05/05/21, 10:48 - Naveen Kumar: Subjective insight is as good as technological advance
05/05/21, 10:53 - Naveen Kumar: Naming is so important...because Phillippe created a best product they have ever made and named it as Air fryers......just because of the name they didn't attract the people that much...even if it clearly says about the product it shouldn't be done...rather they could have named it as Air Soute(French word which refers to as fryers)....since that sounds good it works...
05/05/21, 11:01 - Naveen Kumar: A wedding card wrapped in nice wrapper brings the guests rather than a beautiful video or image which has the same message as of the wedding card....because people always looks out for the price involved in...
05/05/21, 11:03 - Naveen Kumar: It's like companies making celebrity endorsements...people are aware of how much celebrities gonna charge for that ad, so they think that it must be a  successful product because subconsciously they will relate everything...
05/05/21, 11:04 - Vamc Aarya: Cred
05/05/21, 11:04 - Vamc Aarya: This works for ads too?
05/05/21, 11:05 - Naveen Kumar: Yup
05/05/21, 11:05 - Naveen Kumar: If we can have that perspective
05/05/21, 11:05 - Vamc Aarya: Yes
05/05/21, 11:06 - Vamc Aarya: This shows this approach works not only for products but also for the ads promoting the product
05/05/21, 11:06 - Naveen Kumar: Yup
05/05/21, 11:06 - Naveen Kumar: It's psychology and works everywhere
05/05/21, 11:06 - Vamc Aarya: So
05/05/21, 11:06 - Vamc Aarya: Include this point above the table u have started
05/05/21, 11:07 - Vamc Aarya: # subjective approach

05/05/21, 11:08 - Naveen Kumar: For every ad we do we just do some subjective analysis too just to make sure we're on track....
